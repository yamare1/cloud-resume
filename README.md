# Cloud Resume Challenge
Hosted my resume on a static website using Amazon Web Services (AWS), implementing security and optimization measures with services like S3, Cloudfront, DynamoDB, and Lambda. The website includes a live visitor counter, with the frontend developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the backend, I utilized Python scripts to create AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway, handling backend infrastructure such as visitor count tracking and interaction with DynamoDB.
